## General Information
- Develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.
- Trying to detect the gesture for remote control.
- The dataset being used is an image dataset provided by the UpGrad.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- LSTM with SGD as optimizer performs good than with Adam as optimizer.
- CNN3D + l2 Regulaizer showed good improvement but had high learning rate loss.
